# FCG-HW
This repo contains my two homeworks for the Fundamentals of Computer graphics at FMI, Sofia. 
In the moidom.html file I had to make a house plan and two items. <br>
In the mannequin.html file I used the library made for this course by our lecturer (https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/) to make a scene 
of my choice. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hn-dlUu5V0) <br>
The remaining files are the JS libraries that I used for these homeworks.
